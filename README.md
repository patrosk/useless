# Find Bamford

Find Bamford is a silly game where you need to find where the small plastic duck Bamford is hiding. Bamford is named after Patrick Bamford, player in Leeds United. Besides the name, the two have no similarities.

The game requires no skill whatsoever, since Bamford's hiding place is completely random each time the page is refreshed. So don't feel bad if you can't find him on your first try. Good luck!
