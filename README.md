# Find Bamford

Find Bamford is a silly game where you need to find where the small plastic duck Bamford is hiding. Bamford is named after Patrick Bamford, player in Leeds United. Besides the name, the two have no similarities.

The game requires no skill whatsoever, since Bamford's hiding place is completely random each time the page is refreshed. So don't feel bad if you can't find him on your first try. Good luck!

# Code Review

Code review written by [Simon Helier](https://github.com/Sakariash).

1. `app.js:04-05` - The hero picture is covering the text aroundit when spinning.
1. `app.js:45-46` - The random numeber variable could be declared closers to its context for readability. Also the random number is logged in the console, I presume to test if the code runs?
1. `app.js:60` - Another random console.log declaration. Probably as a test to see if the code runs?
1. `style.css` - The contrast on the neon-text could be a little sharper.
1. `usefullness` - Are you positive this page is useless? I spent over 30 minutes trying to catch the duck on the first try three times in a row, seems like a pretty fun time to me! Great work though. Easy-to-read code and well sturcted files!
